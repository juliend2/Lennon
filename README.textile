h1. Lennon

Lennon is a lightweight blogging engine built with Sinatra. It uses CKEditor's WYSIWYG to ease edition of the content. It uses ActiveRecord for interacting with the database. Comments are also stored in the database. For now it is only tested with Sqlite3 but since it uses ActiveRecord it should work with other DBs out of the box. 

h2. Dependencies

You'll need to install these gems :

pre.. sudo gem install sinatra
sudo gem install active_record

h2. Installation

See "http://github.com/juliend2/Lennon/wiki/Installing-Lennon":http://github.com/juliend2/Lennon/wiki/Installing-Lennon

h2. Play with it!

Have some fun. Look at the code. Let me know if there's something missing or broken.
